  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows real-time rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.</details>

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel-view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes a point cloud in a continuous octree-based probability field and a multi-resolution hash grid. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds by retaining favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving fine geometric detail without depending on initial priors like SfM point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on several common benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can extract explicit point clouds to further enhance performance.</details>
